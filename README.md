# ELT process with python

In this project I include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Retrieve data directly from a website through web scraping techniques.
    \item Transform the data as required.
    \item Save the processed data as both a local file and a database table.
    \item Run basic queries on a dataset table.
\end{itemize}

Documentation of each section is provided. Also code to solve each step of the project using python.
